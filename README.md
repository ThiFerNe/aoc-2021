## Prerequisites

Before running aoc-2021 you need:
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) with [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)

## Using the project

Each day is its own subcommand like `cargo run -- day01` with its own arguments viewable with `cargo run -- day01 --help`.

To view all subcommands run `cargo run -- --help`.

For the full speed use `--release` after `cargo run` like `cargo run --release -- day01`.
